# CronJobs

Run (a) job(s) on a repeating schedule

- A CronJob will create a job and a pod for carrying out the task
  - The CronJob is only responsible for scheduling the job
  - The job is responsible for managing the pod
- The kube-controller timezone is used for CronJob `schedule`
- If there are more than 100 missing jobs between either the last job execution time (when `startingDeadlineSeconds` is not set) or the time specified by `startingDeadlineSeconds` to now, the CronJob will not be started and errors will be logged
- There are 2 features can be configured on a CronJob:
  - **startingDeadlineSeconds**: How long the job can be active
  - **concurrencyPolicy**: `Allow|Forbid`. If more than one job can be carried out at the same time

```
apiVersion: batch/v1beta1
kind: CronJob
metadata:
  name: sleepy
spec:
  schedule: "*/1 * * * *"
  jobTemplate:
    spec:
      template:
        spec:
          activeDeadlineSeconds: 10
          containers:
          - name: resting
            image: busybox
            command: ["/bin/sleep"]
            args: ["30"]
          restartPolicy: Never
```

- The CronJob will schedule a job every 1 minute
- The job can be only active for 10s
- The task will sleep for 30s
- The pod will eventually show error `DeadlineExceeded` since it executes longer than `activeDeadlineSeconds`
