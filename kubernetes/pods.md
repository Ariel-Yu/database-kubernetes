# Pods

## Pods concept
* Pod usually has a **1:1** relationship with container
* To scale up the application, we can add more pods with the **same** application image to the same node or add more nodes with containers with the **same** application image to the same cluster
* A pod can have multiple containers. These containers usually have **different** application images. Some of the containers are usually helper containers of another container
* What resources can be shared within a pod
  * Network namespace
  * Storage
  * Same thread
* Pod is transient, when a pod is down, pod managers (replicasets, deployments, daemonsets, statefulsets, jobs) are the ones responsible to bring up a new pod
