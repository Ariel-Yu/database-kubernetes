## Pods concept
* Pod usually has a **1:1** relationship with container
* To scale up the application, we can add more pods with the **same** application image to the same node or add more nodes with containers with the **same** application image to the same cluster
* A pod can have multiple containers. These containers usually have **different** application images. Some of the containers are usually helper containers of another container
* What resources can be shared within a pod
  * Network namespace
  * Storage
  * Same thread
* Pod is transient, when a pod is down, pod managers (replicasets, deployments, daemonsets, statefulsets, jobs) are the ones responsible to bring up a new pod

## Pods kubectl
```
kubectl run <pod_name> --image=<image_name> [-l <label_name>:<Label_value>] --restart=Never -> Create a single pod
kubectl run <pod_name> --image=<image_name> [-l <label_name>:<Label_value>] -> Create a deployment with a replicaset and a pod
kubectl create -f <pod_definition_file>
kubectl create deployment <deployment_name> --image=<image_name> â†’ Create a deployment with a replicaset and a pod

<SHORTNAME of pods = po>
kubectl get pods [<pod_name>]
kubectl get pods [<pod_name>] -o wide
kubectl describe pods [<pod_name>]
kubectl explain pods[.spec.containers.image] --recursive [| wc] [| less]
kubectl logs <pod_name> [<container_name>]

kubectl delete pods <pod_name>
kubectl detele pods -l <label_name>: <label_value>

kubectl exec [-c <container_name>] -it <pod_name> -- /bin/bash -> Get into the container and run bash commands
```

## Pods yml
pod-definition.yml

- nginx
  - The container is listening to port 80
```
apiVersion: v1

kind: Pod

metadata:
  name: ariel-pod
  labels:
    app: ariel

spec:
  containers:
    - name: nginx-container
      image: nginx
      ports:
        containerPort: 80
```

- postgres
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: postgres
  labels:
    tier: db-tier

- spec:
  containers:
    - name: postgres
      image: postgres
      env:
        - name: POSTGRES_PASSWORD
          value: mysecretpassword
```

Create a pod with a yaml file
```
kubectl create -f pod-definition.yml
```

### Command and args
```
docker run <image_name> <executable_command> <parameter>
```
- ex: docker run ubuntu sleep 5

The `executable command` and `parameter` of an image can be defined in the pod definition file as well:
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: myPod
  labels:
    app: myApp

spec:
  containers:
  - name: ubuntu
    image: ubuntu
    command: ["sleep"]
    args: ["5"]
```

### Edit pods specifications
Only the following specifications can be edited for a running pod

- spec.containers.image
- spec.initContainers.image
- spec.activeDeadlineSeconds (??)
- spec.tolerations

## Pods specifications

### resources
- Resources configuraiton is defined on the **container** level
- There are 2 types of resources control:
  - **request**: The accumulated resources requests of containers of a pod will be used by kube-scheduler to decide which node the pod can be deployed to
  - **limit**: If a container consumes more resources than the defined resources limits, the container will be either killed and restarted of marked as can be evicted
  
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  labels:
    run: stressmeout
spec:
  containers:
  - name: stressmeout 
    image: vish/stress
    imagePullPolicy: Always
    resources:
      limits:
        cpu: "1"
        memory: "1Gi"
      requests:
        cpu: "0.5"
        memory: "500Mi"
```

### volumeMounts
There many types of volumes that can be used:
1. emptyDir
    - kubelete will create an empty directory in the shared container space
    - All the containers in the **same** pod which mount to this directory can read/write data into this directory
    - The directory will be erased when the pod dies
    - The directory will be craeted when the pod is created
2. hostPath
    - A resource from the host node filesystem is mounted by hostPath
    - The file or director will be created on the host node if the file or directory doesn't exist
    - The volume is permanent

```
apiVersion: v1

kind: Pod

metadata:
  name: ariel-pod
  labels:
    app: ariel

spec:
  volumes:
    - name: workdir
      emptyDir: {}
  containers:
    - name: nginx-container
      image: nginx
      ports:
        containerPort: 80
      volumeMounts:
        - name: workdir
          mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html
```
- An empty directory `workdir` is created in the shared container space by kubelete
- The container has a shared volume at **its** path /usr/share/nginx/html 
  - `kubectl exec -it <pod_name> [-c <container_name>] -- sh
  - cd /usr/share/nginx/html`
  
### securityContext

### probes
Health checkes of the `containers` in a pod. Probes are defined on the container level

- There are three ways to interact with probes:
  - Command: The check is passed if the command returns true
  - HTTP request: The check is passed if HTTP request returns a code between 200 ~ 399
  - TCP socket: The check is passed if the kubelete can successfully establish a connection to the mentioned port of the container
- initialDelaySeconds: How long kubelete will wait before it executes the probe
- periodSeconds: How often kubelete will run the probe

#### readinessProbe
Check if a container is ready. kubelete will only send traffic to the containers whose readinessProbe is passed
 
```
apiVersion: v1

kind: Pod

metadata:
  name: ariel-pod
  labels:
    app: ariel

spec:
  containers:
    - name: nginx-container
      image: nginx
      ports:
        containerPort: 80
      volumeMounts:
        - name: workdir
          mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html
      readinessProbe:
        exec:
          command:
            - cat
            - /tmp/healthy
        initialDelaySeconds: 5
        periodSeconds: 5
```
- The readiness probe is passed after the command `cat /tmp/healthy` returns `true`

#### livenessProbe
Check if a container is running healthy. A container that fails the livenessProbe will be killed and restarted by kubelete
```
apiVersion: v1

kind: Pod

metadata:
  name: ariel-pod
  labels:
    app: ariel

spec:
  containers:
    - name: nginx-container
      image: nginx
      ports:
        containerPort: 80
      volumeMounts:
        - name: workdir
          mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html
      readinessProbe:
        exec:
          command:
            - cat
            - /tmp/healthy
        initialDelaySeconds: 5
        periodSeconds: 5
      livenessProbe:
        tcpSocket:
          port: 8080
        initialDeplaySeconds: 15
        periodSeconds: 20
```
- The readiness probe is passed after the command `cat /tmp/healthy` returns `true`
- The liveness probe is passed if kubelete can establish a successful connection to the container port 8080
